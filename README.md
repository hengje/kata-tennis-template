Simple template for a new Tennis kata
=====================================

Rules:
-----
1.  Each player can have either of these points in one game: 0, 15, 30, 40.
2.  If you have 40 and you win the ball you win the game.
3.  If both have 40 the players are deuce.
    * If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage and game ball.
    * If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game
    * If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.

Methodology
-----------

*   TDD and "Ping pong"
    1. Write a test for a new function. The test should fail.
    2. Switch "driver" in the pair
    3. Write code until the test passes.
    4. Refactor until the code is suitable for continued development
    5. Goto 1.
*   "Baby steps"
    * The next step to take should always be as small as possible. *Yes,* *as* *small* *as* *possible.*

Retro:
-----
*   What, if anything, did you learn today?
*   What, if anything, surprised you today?
*   What, if anything, will you do differently in the future?
