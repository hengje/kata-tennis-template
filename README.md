Rules:

1.  Each player can have either of these points in one game: 0, 15, 30, 40.
2.  If you have 40 and you win the ball you win the game.
3.  If both have 40 the players are deuce.
    * If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage and game ball.
    * If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game
    * If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.
